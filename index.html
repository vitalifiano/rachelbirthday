                <h2>dear my baby</h2>
                <p>i've been reflecting on our time together and have always admired your qualities—your strength, your determination to stay and be with me. yet, i believe it is better this way, perhaps your life has become much more peaceful without me. please know that, despite the fact that i left, my support for you remains unwavering.</p>
                <p>i am genuinely proud of everything you have accomplished so far, and i will continue to be proud of you in the future. i will always hold a special place in my heart for you, and i will forever love you, my baby. </p>
                <p>i hope today brings genuine happiness for you; your happiness is all i could ever ask for. please remain true to who you are, rachel. you are wonderful, caring, and kindhearted—i hope you realize that. anyway, i hope you have a wonderful birthday, have lots of fun, and enjoy your time.</p>
                <p> i've been crying since that day. i miss us.</p>
